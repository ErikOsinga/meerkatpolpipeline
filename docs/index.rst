meerkatpolpipeline documentation
================================

MeerKAT polarisation data reduction and analysis pipeline. 


This pipeline supports a range of functionalities, including downloading uncalibrated data, cross-calibration, verification of results against known calibrator models, (DI/DD) self-calibration, polarization cube imaging, RM synthesis, and the creation of preliminary science plots (*work in progress*).


The pipeline uses Prefect (https://www.prefect.io/) to track task dependencies and logs.
